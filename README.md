# Video Game: Fitaita

![fitaita2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37341054/83773603-66971b80-a68d-11ea-9fd3-5bf804fbdba1.png)

Fitaita is an RPG video game built with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io), an open source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered games. This game was inspired by [Phaser 3 tutorial: Endless Runner](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1). The main objective was to create a custom role play game.

Assignment [link](https://www.notion.so/Platform-game-4a55a7d1fcc245bcb012c76814764712).

## Overview
Fitaita is a single player based game. The game is intended to determine how fast a player can collect enough coins against the man-eater fishes. The game has infinite levels and the player is  expected to collect 5000 coins in order to escape the underworld.
Two man-eater fishes are being introduced to the gameplay starting from level two. The player has to manoeuvre and avoid getting contact with the fishes.

## Gameplay
###### Player
Player (Fita) uses the direction keys( up: to jump and move to upper blocks, down: to move down in a faster way, left: to move left, right: to move right). He continues on in quest to collect enough coins to defeat the power of the fish.

###### Enemy
Fishes (Ita) of blue and green colors are released from random directions into game. They will continue swimming looking for food.


## Design and Thinking
In the first day I got introduced to the new Phaserjs library and I got started with the documentation from the [official docs](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/). I took a couple of days understanding the concepts.
On the fifth day, I came up with my game mechanics, including the game name, players, enemy, levels and scoring system. The day after, I starting coding based on my own plan.

## Assets
All sprites, images and sounds used in this game are from [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org).
